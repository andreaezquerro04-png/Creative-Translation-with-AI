# Creative-Translation-with-AI
This project explores how to use models of Generative AI to translate texts between different languages, maintaining the literary and creative style. The goal is to go beyond literal translation, generating results that preserve the tone, emotion, and intent of the original text.

Technologies used:
- Python 3
- Google Colab
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`

How to use it
1. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to load the translation model.
3. Enter your text in the input field.
4. Obtain the creative translation generated by the model.

Example result
**Original text (English):** 
*"The night whispered secrets only the moon could keep."* 
**Literal translation:** 
*"La noche susurraba secretos que solo la luna podía guardar."*
**Creative translation (AI):**
*"La noche murmuraba confidencias que solo la luna sabía proteger."*
